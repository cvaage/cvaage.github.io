<br>About a decade ago, I began curating my education and experiences to build a comprehensive understanding of how we interact with our world. 
This ambition led me through a diverse spread of ecosystems, agencies, and communities, contributing to my identity as an environmental steward.
I intend for this website to be a platform to share my research interests, past engagements, and current work with potential collaborators, advisers, and friends ( and reflect with myself ! ).<br><br>

"But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you."
