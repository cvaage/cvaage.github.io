### Background
The foundational years of my career can be summarized by a drive to understand how we view and manage the natural world. This ambition drove me to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree in Environmental Studies at Boise State University. As an undergraduate, I was able to amass experience in education curricula development, local and state politics, and land management across the Western US. The pinnacle of my undergraduate career was being named a Top Ten Scholar of the 2022 graduating class. I joined the [Freshwater Ecology and Conservation Lab](https://www.oldenfish.com/) at the University of Washington in the fall of 2022. Please see my [Research](https://cvaage.github.io/research/chapter1) page for more information about my master's thesis.
